# Security Policy

## 🔒 Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Mimir project takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings.

### 🚨 Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report them via one of the following methods:

- **Email**: security@mimir-project.org
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: [Private vulnerability reporting](https://github.com/your-org/mimir/security/advisories/new)

### 📝 What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of issue** (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting)
- **Full paths** of source files related to the manifestation of the issue
- **Location** of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- **Special configuration** required to reproduce the issue
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the issue
- **Proof-of-concept or exploit code** (if possible)
- **Impact** of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

## 🕐 Response Timeline

- **Initial response**: Within 48 hours
- **Detailed assessment**: Within 7 days
- **Security patch**: Critical issues within 14 days, others within 30 days
- **Public disclosure**: After patch is available and users have time to update

## 🏆 Security Researcher Recognition

We believe in recognizing security researchers who help keep Mimir secure:

- **Hall of Fame**: Public recognition on our website
- **CVE assignment**: For qualifying vulnerabilities
- **Swag**: Mimir merchandise for significant findings
- **Early notification**: Advance notice of security-related releases

## 🛡️ Supported Versions

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.1.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.1   | :x:                |

## 🔐 Security Features

Mimir implements multiple layers of security:

### Encryption
- **XChaCha20-Poly1305** for content encryption
- **Argon2** for key derivation
- **Per-class encryption keys** for fine-grained access control
- **SQLCipher** for database encryption

### Access Control
- **App-level ACLs** with explicit permission grants
- **Memory class isolation** (personal, work, health, etc.)
- **Zero-knowledge architecture** for cloud sync
- **Local-first design** minimizes attack surface

### Data Protection
- **PII detection and redaction** before storage
- **Memory aging and compression** to limit data retention
- **Secure deletion** with cryptographic key destruction
- **No plaintext logging** of sensitive data

### Supply Chain Security
- **Reproducible builds** with verified checksums
- **Dependency auditing** via `cargo audit`
- **Signed releases** with GPG signatures
- **Minimal dependencies** to reduce attack surface

## 🔍 Security Audits

### Completed Audits
- *None yet - project is in early development*

### Planned Audits
- **Q4 2025**: Full security audit before v1.0 release

## 🚀 Security Development Practices

### Code Review
- **All changes** require review by a maintainer
- **Security-sensitive code** requires review by security team
- **Cryptographic code** requires specialized review

### Testing
- **Unit tests** for all cryptographic functions
- **Property-based testing** for security-critical code
- **Integration tests** for access control mechanisms
- **Fuzz testing** for parser and network code

### Dependencies
- **Regular updates** of security-related dependencies
- **Automated scanning** via GitHub Security Advisories
- **Minimal dependency policy** to reduce attack surface

## 📋 Security Checklist for Contributors

When contributing code that handles sensitive data:

- [ ] **Input validation** for all external inputs
- [ ] **Output encoding** for all outputs
- [ ] **Error handling** that doesn't leak sensitive information
- [ ] **Memory safety** considerations (no buffer overflows)
- [ ] **Cryptographic best practices** (proper key management, secure randomness)
- [ ] **Access control** checks where appropriate
- [ ] **Audit logging** for security-relevant events
- [ ] **Documentation** of security assumptions and requirements
